About Me:

I am currently a senior in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University. Minoring in Watershed Science. I am expected to graduate December of 2025. I love reading, listening to music, and going on hikes with my dog, Perry. I am interested in stream health management, ecosystem reclamation, and building better sustainable approaches for businesses.
