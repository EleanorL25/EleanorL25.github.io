# Class Projects

In the Spring semester of 2025 I took a class titled Quantitative Reasoning which was based in R. I wrote lots of code and put together some different projects. Below I have posted links to some of this work.

What I learned from this activity:

-   How to connect projects to github

-   A more in depth view of Rstudio and the mechanics available to use

-   How to set up by folders to be better organized

## Watershed Practicum

Watershed practicum trip (Summer 2024). A group of watershed science students and I went on a week long trip along the Uncompahgre watershed and talked with professionals in various fields of environmental science. We learned how to use different field equipment.

## Environmental Internship

Over the summer I worked as an intern for H2E, and environmental consultation company. While working with them I was able to go out and conduct vegetation and storm water assessments for various oil and gas sites. I compiled weekly reports and made map changes in ArcGIS when applicable.

# Quantitative Reasoning Labs

## lab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth

![Final question in Lab 2 pulling the top three fastest growing trees](lab-2.png)

From this lab I learned how to create tibbles and to filter data into a format that answers precise questions. I also learned how to use dplyr.

## Lab 3: COVID Wrangling

From this lab I learned more about flextables and how to read in data into R studio. I also gained confidence in mapping and data cleaning/assigning through this lab.

## Lab 4: LTER Network Data

From this lab I learned a lot about R in general. I was exposed to correlation tests, graphing with detailed organization, and how to conduct linear regressions in R. I was also introduced to the ggpubr package in this lab which has continued to be implemented in labs throughout the semester.

## lab 5: Personal Project Proposal

This lab was a huge step forward in my understanding of what all R studio can accomplish. We created a quarto manuscript to create a draft website for our final project. This lab allowed my teammates and I to come up with two questions we could explore in R. I learned how to use a reference page in R to cite my sources, how to add other collaborators, how to organize a quarto manuscript, and further exercised my knowledge on personalizing a website page in R.

## Lab 6: ML Workflows

This lab marked the second half of the semester as it was the first lab back from spring break. The difference. between this lab and the earlier ones is that this lab strayed from basics in R and started getting into how researchers actually use R. I learned how to build, test, and use different models as well as how to decide which models are better than others depending on the data loaded into R. I also cemented knowledge on how to use ggplot2 to create intelligent graphs that describe and show data in a concise, clean way.

## Lab 7: Project Kickoff

This lab was a continuation of lab 5 in that our group chose a research question and completed data analysis on a set of data we pulled, cleaned, and analyzed by ourselves. Through this lab I learned how to gather my own data, read it into R, clean it in R, and analyze it to answer a distinct question crafted by my team and I. I also learned how to use ggplotly to make our graphs more detailed.

## Lab 8: ML Tuning

This lab was the second part to lab 6 (ML Workflow) and acted as the interpretation of the random forest model from the previous lab. I learned how to add a shadow to a line of best fit within ggplot2 and how to determine the accuracy of models in R. I also gained knowledge in the various models available to use in data interpretation in R.

## Lab 9: Results/Discussion Draft

![Discussion section of our final report for personal project.](lab-9.png)

This was the final draft of our report for the personal project. The lab as an accumulation of everything we have worked on including the research, data analysis, data visualization, results, and conclusion. From this lab I strengthened my interpretation skills as well as my knowledge on how to trouble shoot in R for various errors. I also learned how to rename a website without changing the name of the file.

## Lab 10: Distance to the Border

![graph of cities in the US that are qual distance from Canada as they are from Mexico.](lab-10.png)

This lab was one of my favorites if not my favorite. I learned so much more about ggplot and what all it can do. This was also the first lab where I felt like I understood what I was doing the entire lab. I learned how to color graphs on a scale rather than one solid color.

## Lab 11: Lightning Talks

This lab was just a presentation of everyone's projects. ADD WHAT I LEARNED AFTER LAB TO ADD IF I LEARNED ANYTHING FROM OTHER PROJECTS.
