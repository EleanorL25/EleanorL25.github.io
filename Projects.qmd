In the Spring semester of 2025 I took a class titled Quantitative Reasoning which was based in R. I wrote lots of code and put together some different projects. Below I have posted links to some of this work.

What I learned from this activity:

-   How to connect projects to github

-   A more in depth view of Rstudio and the mechanics available to use

-   How to set up by folders to be better organized

Watershed practicum trip (Summer 2024). A group of watershed science students and I went on a week long trip along the Uncompahgre watershed and talked with professionals in various fields of environmental science. We learned how to use different field equipment.
