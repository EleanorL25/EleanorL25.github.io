    "text": "In the Spring semester of 2025 I took a class titled Quantitative Reasoning which was based in R. I wrote lots of code and put together some different projects. Below I have posted links to some of this work.\nWhat I learned from this activity:\n\nHow to connect projects to github\nA more in depth view of Rstudio and the mechanics available to use\nHow to set up by folders to be better organized\n\n\n\nWatershed practicum trip (Summer 2024). A group of watershed science students and I went on a week long trip along the Uncompahgre watershed and talked with professionals in various fields of environmental science. We learned how to use different field equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the summer I worked as an intern for H2E, and environmental consultation company. While working with them I was able to go out and conduct vegetation and storm water assessments for various oil and gas sites. I compiled weekly reports and made map changes in ArcGIS when applicable."

I learned how to use a reference page in R to cite my sources, how to add other collaborators, how to organize a quarto manuscript, and further exercised my knowledge on personalizing a website page in R."

I learned how to build, test, and use different models as well as how to decide which models are better than others depending on the data loaded into R. I also cemented knowledge on how to use ggplot2 to create intelligent graphs that describe and show data in a concise, clean way."

Through this lab I learned how to gather my own data, read it into R, clean it in R, and analyze it to answer a distinct question crafted by my team and I.
